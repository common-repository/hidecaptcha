This plugin hides the Google reCaptcha Version 3 logo on all pages except the pages that contain a Contactform 7 form.

== Description ==
 
As of version 3 of the reCaptcha, adding this functionality to your website makes the logo of Google appear on all pages of your website. 
The plugin loads 2.5 seconds after the page has loaded. This is because we need to give Contactform 7 time to show its form. 

The plugin will work on most WordPress installations, there's hardly any php code, so hardly any server requirements.
At this point in time it does require jQuery, which is handled automatically. 

== Installation ==
 
Install the plugin as per usual, alongside recaptcha version 3. 
After activation, you should see the reCaptcha logo disappear from all pages except the ones that have a Contactform 7 form.
