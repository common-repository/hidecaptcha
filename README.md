# plugin_scola_recaptcha

This plugin hides the Google reCaptcha Version 3 logo on all pages except the pages that contain a Contactform 7 form.

As of version 3 of the reCaptcha, adding this functionality to your website makes the logo of Google appear on all pages of your website. 
The plugin loads 2.5 seconds after the page has loaded. This is because we need to give Contactform 7 time to show its form.
